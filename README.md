**A single-page Rust resource for people who like high information density.**

Use cases, in order of priority:
* **identification & lookup guide** for constructs encountered in code,
* **discover** parts of the language you might not know,
* **learn about Rust** if you have prior programming experience.


# Building

Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), the static site generator written in Rust. See [`.zolaversion`](.zolaversion) for the exact version the official site was deployed with. To develop locally download the indicated version, then run:

```
zola serve
```



# Contributing

Contributions are welcome and you can PR bug fixes directly. If you somehow ended up here but prefer not to use Github write to [webmaster@cheats.rs](mailto:webmaster@cheats.rs), or use the on-site buttons.

Constructive feedback would be most actionable, but if you just want to vent your frustration that's fine too :)
