# Background

**A single-page Rust resource for people who like high information density.**

Use cases, in order of priority:
* **identification & lookup guide** for constructs encountered in code,
* **discover** parts of the language you might not know,
* **learn about Rust** if you have prior programming experience.

Design guides:
* have **high information density**; every word counts.
* be **printer and mobile friendly**
* don't repeat what's better explained elsewhere, but do state the very essence.
* have **memorable URL** :)


# Building

Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), the static site generator written in Rust. To develop locally install Zola, then run:

```
zola serve
```
